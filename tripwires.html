<h1>Tripwire Detection</h1>

We demonstrated the detection of a real metal tripwire in the lab using a 
new camera (<a href=https://gopro.com/en/us/update/hero6>GoPro HERO 6 Black</a>) with a modified 
version of the code used for the August 2023 demonstration.

We used a <a href=https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/p/eos-rebel-t7-ef-s-18-55mm-f-3-5-5-6-is-ii>Canon 
Rebel T7 DSLR camera</a> connected to a 
<a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/>raspberry pi</a> for
our field experiments.

<p>

The raspberry pi collected and processed continuous frames from the
Canon at a rate of about 2.5 frames per second. Each frame was run
through a python algorithm running on the pi that had been developed
to quickly detect linear features in the frame.
The processed frames were displayed in real time on a remote laptop
that was connected through a WiFi hotspot to the mounted pi.

<p>


For the field test, the camera and pi were mounted on a 
<a href=https://clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/>Clearpath
jackal</a> robotic platform which was steered into the test field toward a
mounted tripwire.
The three wires used were nylon fishing string, metal picture hanger
wire spray painted light green, and military grade green metal wire
that is used in real minefields.

<p>

The system was able to clearly detect three different wires at a distance of
about 50 cm against a background of tall, wild grass. All of the wires were
positioned horizontally at a height of about 35 cm off the ground.
